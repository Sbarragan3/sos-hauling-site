    <h1>About SOS Hauling</h1>
    <p>SOS Hauling began over 20 years ago with nothing but a dream and a borrowed truck. Today, we’re proud to serve Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles County with reliable, community-first hauling, demolition, fencing, landscaping, handyman, and bobcat services.</p>
    <p>We're a family-driven business built on hard work, integrity, and open communication. Whether the job is big or small, we don’t stop until the customer is satisfied.</p>
    <p>We treat every project with respect, and every client like a neighbor — because around here, you probably are.</p>
