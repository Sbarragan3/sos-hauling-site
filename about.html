    <h1>About SOS Hauling</h1>
    <p>SOS Hauling began over 20 years ago with nothing but a dream and a borrowed truck. What started as a side hustle has grown into a trusted, community-rooted business proudly serving Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties.</p>

    <p>We’re not a franchise — we’re family. We believe in showing up, working hard, and treating every customer like a neighbor. Because around here, you probably are.</p>

    <p>Whether it’s hauling, demolition, landscaping, or handyman work, we take pride in doing the job right — every time. No shortcuts. Just honest work and open communication from start to finish.</p>

    <p>We’re grateful for the trust our community has placed in us, and we’re excited to keep growing, one project at a time.</p>
