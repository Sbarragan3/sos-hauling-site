    <h1>About SOS Hauling</h1>
    <p>SOS Hauling started with a dream, a borrowed truck, and a drive to do things right. Over 20 years later, we’re still showing up — with our own gear, our own crew, and the same hard work and honesty that built this business from the ground up.</p>

    <p>We’re family-owned, community-based, and proud of the reputation we’ve earned. Most of our work comes from repeat clients and referrals — folks who know we show up on time, get the job done, and keep our word.</p>

    <p>We specialize in hauling, demolition, fencing, landscaping, handyman help, and Bobcat work. But more than that, we specialize in being reliable — the kind of crew you can trust to handle your property with care, work hard, and keep you in the loop the whole way through.</p>

    <p><strong>We’re not just a service — we’re your neighbors.</strong> And we’re here whenever you need a hand.</p>
